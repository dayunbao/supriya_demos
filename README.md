# Supriya Demos

I created this repo to hold scripts that demo different features of [Supriya](https://github.com/supriya-project/supriya/).  Supriya is a Python API for [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).  It allows you to create 
* synthesizers
* drum machines
* sequencers
* effects
* samplers
* algorithmic music

and much more using Python. 

I share the scripts in this repo in the Supriya subreddit I created [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/supriya_python/).

To run all of the scripts here, you'll need to at least install Supriya and SuperCollider, as well as [mido](https://pypi.org/project/mido/) for the scripts that use MIDI.  I use Pipenv to manage my Python versions and virtual environments.  Since the `Pipfile` is part of this repo, you can install from that if you also use Pipenv.  Alternatively, you could create a `requirements.txt` file from the `Pipfile`.
