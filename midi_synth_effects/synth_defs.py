    """Create a SynthDef.  SynthDefs are used to create Synth instances
    that play the notes.

    WARNING: It is very easy to end up with a volume MUCH higher than
    intended when using SuperCollider.  I've attempted to help with
    this by adding a Limiter UGen to this SynthDef.  Depending on your
    OS, audio hardware, and possibly a few other factors, this might
    set the volume too low to be heard.  If so, first adjust the Limiter's
    `level` argument, then adjust the SynthDef's `amplitude` argument.
    NEVER set the `level` to anything higher than 1.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!

    Args:
        frequency: the frequency in hertz of a note.
        amplitude: the volume.
        gate: an int, 1 or 0, that controls the envelope.
